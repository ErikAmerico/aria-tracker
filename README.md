Aria Tracker is a visitor scheduling calendar ‚Äî presented here as **Visitation Scheduler** for clarity.

Originally built to manage hospital visits for Aria, this app includes two modes:

- ü•≥ **Celebration Mode (Static):** Created after Aria‚Äôs hospital discharge ‚ù§Ô∏è, this version shows a hardcoded visit history (pulled from the Neon database) with celebratory confetti effects.
- üìÖ **Live Calendar Mode (Legacy):** A fully interactive version with database integration, guest management, and real-time updates via Pusher. It's still available for future use or demo purposes.

No login required ‚Äî it's designed to be fast, friendly, and mobile-ready.

### ‚ú® Features

- üìÖ **Time-block scheduling**
- ‚ö° **Real-time updates** with Pusher (legacy mode)
- ü•≥ **Confetti animations** (celebration mode)
- ‚úÖ **Visitor-specific editing**
- üì± **Mobile-friendly**
- üîê **Client-only identification** (via localStorage)

### üôè Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by my daughter Aria, during her time in the hospital. Due to visitation limits, only a certain number of people could be with her at once ‚Äî which made scheduling difficult.

We needed a simple way for both sides of our family to coordinate visits without constantly messaging us, and without us manually juggling everyone‚Äôs availability. This app made that possible ‚Äî and helped us focus on Aria instead of logistics.

It‚Äôs a small project with a big heart: built to bring structure to chaos, and make sure no visit was missed.
